```

AS A reporter
I WANT TO store a list of website articles
SO THAT I can keep track of what I have/haven't read pertaining to my current story

AS A teacher
I WANT TO make a single page of multiple sites for my students
SO THAT I can send out a single link and have the students view multiple websites

AS AN employee
I WANT TO make a single page of the multiple websites I use often

```

## Project Notes

This "browser parking lot" is a single place to store a to-do list of web pages that need to be revisited. It uses react and css. In the future, I would like to imporve on my understanding, planning process, and time management. Other deliverables are inclosed within the wireframe folder.
